# Wizard War 3

**Team Members:** [Jack Gendill, Owen Borgos]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Like if source physics, Ultrakill, and SuperHot all were in an unhappy relationship.
**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game's speed will be adjusted by your playstyle in real time. The enemies will also be fully interactible, with the character being able to pick up and use the enemies as a shield against projectiles, or a projectile themselves.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player character is a black ops chronomancer, so the speed the game runs at will be dependant on how you play. This, combined with combos and destructive enemies, will make the game infinitely replayable.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
We plan on creating 3 individual levels, with a boss at the end of each, offering a decent challenge for the players to overcome. We will likely introduce a new tool in each of the levels, and have the artistic styling change with it.
